    <h1>Proxies and Forwarders</h1>

    <p>
        Many Japanese companies (including Gift and various resellers and storefronts)
        don't want to deal with shipping outside of Japan, for various reasons. However,
        people outside of Japan can still order from them through the use of a proxy
        or a forwarder. Keep in mind that, depending on your country, you may have to pay
        import taxes, customs, or other fees.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <i>forwarder</i> provides a package forwarding service. They will provide you a Japanese
        address (similar to a P.O. box in the United States) for you to have goods shipped to, and
        will forward any packages that arrive at that address to your real, overseas address. Some
        forwarders also provide package consolidation services that can saving on shipping and customs
        costs. <i>Note: to comply with Japanese anti-gang laws, forwarders will require you to demonstrate
        proof of address and identity before actually forwarding your package. Typically, this is a
        photo of your ID and a bill with your name and address.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        A <i>proxy</i> is similar to a forwarder, except that they will place the online order for you.
        Typically, you provide a link to the item you want to buy and a brief description of the item,
        and then the proxy provides status updates as the order/delivery process proceeds. Many proxies
        require a deposit. Some storefronts refuse to do business with proxy services, although Gift is
        not known to turn away proxies.

        The following is a partial list of Proxy and Forwarding services, with some basic information about each.
        <i>Note: fees do not include shipping costs, since they vary dramatically based on destination and store.</i>
        Please keep in mind that there are <i>two</i> shipping costs: one from the seller to the proxy/forwarder,
        and one from the proxy/forwarder to you.

        <i>Sniper Bids</i> are bids placed close to the end of an auction.
        Costs per order are often reduced when ordering multiple items from the same seller in a 24 hour period.
        Check the individual sites for more information.
