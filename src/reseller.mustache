    <h1>Fumo Resellers and Storefronts</h1>
    <h2>Spotting Bootlegs</h2>
    <p>
        All official Fumos originally came with either a tag or a tin badge. If that is missing, that could be
        a sign of a bootleg (although it's possible the seller lost the tag or badge, or bought it from someone
        else who originally lost the tag or badge). A missing tag will generally lower the price too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep in mind that Fumos originally sell for around $40 (or around $500 for a Deka). If you see a price
        lower than that, it's very likely to be a bootleg or other fraudulent listing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Look at the photos in the listing. Try reverse image searching them to make sure they're unique.
        If the Fumo looks particularly derpy, it's probably a bootleg. You can compare against the stock
        photos in our <a href="/fumolist">Fumo List</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some bootleg Deka Fumos with very long legs (the originals have the same stubby legs as their
        smaller counterparts).
